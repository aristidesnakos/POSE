# What it is

Practical One Shot Evaluations of Multimodal Language Models (POSE) is an ongoing collection of prompts that can be used just by copying and pasting the prompt into an AI Editor such as:

- Cursor, Windurf, Cline, etc
- Lovable, Bolt.new, Same.dev, etc

# Why 

This was prompted by the AI Showdown competition Lovable hosted on June 14th-June 16th 2025.
It asked for head to head comparisons of OpenAI, Gemini, and Anthropic using its editor.

Also, this was an opportunity to finally launch a set of practical evaluations with immediate usage potential.

# Target Audience

- Software enthusiasts
- People that are curious about LLM capabilities
- People surveying LLM limitations
